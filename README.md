Lots of games uploaded, havnt had time to add a site to all the links and file paths though.

Lots of stuff done now need to make sure that search for games work, settings ui, ask for confirm feature doesnt apply for urls in the site, and finallmy, get proxy working, some other small things like universal navbar and webtro and rom, idk how imma sort that out.
