One of the best option to cure bordom in school. 

Lots of games uploaded, havnt had time to add a site to all the links and file paths though.

Proxy is up! Credit to the ultravoilet team and the TIW team for it. nope got more links def hosting internally once i get dynamic webhost tho (and chat can become reality)


to do 

make game open in a new iframe with tab cloak applied, make a lot of games local, make proxy unblocked by hosting the website dynamically or importing tomp https, style the UI for settings
